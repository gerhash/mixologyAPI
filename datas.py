        "story":'''
            The history of the Old Fashioned cocktail begins at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel, a well-known luxury hotel in New York. Colonel James Pepper was a regular at the Waldorf and was a member of the Pendennis Club of Louisville. Here he had tasted a drink very similar to the Old Fashioned, invented for him who loved old-fashioned whiskey. Once he arrived at Astoria, he taught the barman the recipe they had created for him at Pendennis, giving life to a cocktail that made history.

    ''',
        "story": '''
            The origins of the daiquiri are unclear, in fact two different stories are attributed to its birth. The first dates back to 1898: during the war between Spain and the United States, after the sinking of the Maine ship in the port of Havana, a marine disembarks in Daiquiri, a Cuban village, enters a bar and asks for something to quench his thirst, too bad that the taproom offered only rum. The sailor thus decides to dilute it with lime juice and sugar, creating the first daiquiri.
            The second legend about the birth of the daiquiri moves the date a few years later, to 1905: it is said that the cocktail was invented by American engineers working in an iron mine. At the end of the day, to recover from the hard work, they decided to drink something, but they only had rum, lime and sugar available, which they mixed in a shaker with ice. Initially they called the cocktail "rum sour", but it was deemed too simple and later changed to daiquiri.
            In addition to the uncertain origins, there is a curiosity that made the daiquiri known: it was one of Ernest Hemingway's favorite drinks, together with the mojito, a famous Cuban cocktail also much appreciated by Fidel Castro.

        To make the Margarita, start by placing some crushed ice in a margarita glass or shaker. Let cool for 3 minutes 1.

    ''',
        "story": '''
The Margarita is an alcoholic cocktail based on triple sec, lime juice and tequila, a Mexican brandy extracted from the agave fruit: although it contains the aromas of Mexico, it is widespread and appreciated internationally as an after dinner or aperitif. It is a drink included in the sour category, i.e. drinks composed of a distillate, lemon juice and a sweetener, and is served in the typical Sombrero cup, the edge of which is wetted with lime juice and sprinkled with salt.
Of uncertain origin, its birth is debated between Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, the Californian city closest to the border. According to some, it was born in the late 1930s, in honor of the Mexican actress Marjorie King, while others associate it with the custom of drinking tequila paired with a slice of lemon covered in salt.

Preparing a Hugo or a white Spritz is very simple but Vincenzo Pagliara also tells us some tricks for having a perfect cocktail to drink at home with friends on summer evenings.
Pour the ingredients into a glass, preferably a goblet, with plenty of ice. Garnish with a sprig of mint to complete your white spritz. If you are wondering which prosecco to use for the Hugo, it seems that Gruber used a Prosecco Superiore Conegliano Valdobbiadene: a bottle that costs around 9 euros.
If you can't find elderflower syrup, you can easily use lemon balm flower syrup because the difference is really minimal. Remember to serve the drink immediately to prevent the ice from melting and compromising the quality of the cocktail. The alcohol content is low, around 8 degrees, but it is advisable not to abuse it.    ''',
        "story": '''
         The Hugo is a simple variant of the spritz, for this reason it is often known as the "white spritz", and unfortunately it does not have a fascinating history of intrigue and love stories like many other drinks. It was born at the beginning of 2000 in the province of Bolzano thanks to Roland Gruber, a barman from Naturns, looking for an alternative to the classic spritz. The idea of ​​replacing bitter with lemon balm proved to be a winning idea and in a very short time it spread throughout Trentino Alto-Adige and even crossed the Alps, becoming a very famous drink in Austria and Germany.
A few years after Gruber's recipe we already move on to the first change of ingredients: away with the lemon balm, too sweet, in with elderberry syrup also because it is much easier to find. As for the name, there is a story told in Val di Fossa which has no confirmation: Hugo would be a tribute made by the innkeeper Filippo Debertol, to a customer who every year would bring as a gift a syrup made with elderflowers by himself collected. The elderly gentleman would be called Hugo and it is in his honor that Filippo would have decided to name the cocktail created with those flowers. In reality, according to a report by Der Spiegel, the name was chosen at random by its creator: initially he thought of Otto, but it didn't seem suitable, so it became Hugo.   ''',
