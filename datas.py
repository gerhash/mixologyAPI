            Place a sugar cube in an old fashioned glass and sprinkle it with two drops of angostura. Make a splash of soda and crush with the muddler until the sugar is completely dissolved. Add ice until the glass is filled, add the whiskey and mix. Stir with a bar spoon and decorate the glass with a slice of orange after leaving its essence on the edge of the glass. Place a maraschino cherry in the glass and serve the Old Fashioned cocktail.

        "story":'''
            The history of the Old Fashioned cocktail begins at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel, a well-known luxury hotel in New York. Colonel James Pepper was a regular at the Waldorf and was a member of the Pendennis Club of Louisville. Here he had tasted a drink very similar to the Old Fashioned, invented for him who loved old-fashioned whiskey. Once he arrived at Astoria, he taught the barman the recipe they had created for him at Pendennis, giving life to a cocktail that made history.
